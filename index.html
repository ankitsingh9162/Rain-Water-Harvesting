                <h3>Groundwater Recharging</h3>
                <p>‘V-wire injection well &#x27;technology is used to recharge groundwater source and replenish the water table. Run off rainwater is made to pass into a silt trap through a channel and then to an injection well. Here, it goes through multiple filtration media and is eventually passed on to a specially designed storage well. The storage well has dual non clogging V-Wire screens attached to a percolator pipe. The clean water is then made to percolate into deep layers of the earth &#x27;s strata, ultimately recharging the groundwater source and replenishing the water table.</p>

This Cookie Policy explains how and why cookies and other similar technologies may be stored on and accessed from your device when you use or visit FRHS Website or application that posts a link to this Policy (collectively, “the websites” or “the Sites”). This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Our website uses cookies, tags and other technologies when you use any of the services on the FRHS websites, mobile sites or mobile apps (collectively “the services”). Cookies are used to ensure everyone has their best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies or web beacons, then you should stop using our website/ mobile application, or consult your browsing and third-party cookie settings as described below.</p>

                                <strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong>
                                Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website/ mobile application you visit in your browser and subsequently sent by your web browser in every request to the website/ mobile application. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the FRHS servers. Cookies allow FRHS to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on our Site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may analyse or perform analysis based on the use of these technologies and generate reports on an individual and aggregated basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>Cookies can be &quot;persistent &quot;or &quot;session &quot;cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to website or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by FRHS when you return to one of our sites/ applications or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website/ application or a browser session).</p>
                            <p>The other tracking technologies work similarly to cookies and place small data files on your devices or monitor your website/ mobile application activity to enable us to collect information about how you use our websites/ applications. This allows our websites/ applications to recognize your device from those of other users of the Sites. The information provided below about cookies also applies to these other tracking technologies.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>HOW DO OUR WEBSITES/ MOBILE APPLICATIONS USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong>
                                FRHS uses cookies and other tracking technologies to identify you and your interests, to remember your preferences, and to track your use of our website/ mobile application. We also use cookies and other tracking technologies to control access to certain content on our website/ mobile application, protect the websites/ mobile applications, and show you advertisements and to process any requests that you make to us.
                            </p>
                            <p>To administer our website/ mobile application and for research purposes, FRHS also has contracted with third-party service providers to track and analyse statistical usage and volume information from our site users. These third-party service providers use persistent cookies to help us to improve the user experience, manage our site content, and analyse how users navigate and utilize the website/ mobile application.</p>

                                We use cookies on our websites, mobile sites and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us which helps us identify you more quickly when you return. We will not use &quot;cookies &quot;or other technologies to follow your click stream on the Internet generally, but will use them, and other devices, to determine which pages or information you find most useful or interesting at our own website/ mobile application.

                                <strong>HOW COOKIES ARE USED FOR ONLINE ANALYTICS PURPOSES?</strong>
                                We may use web analytics services on our Services, such as, but not limited to those of Google Analytics. These services help us analyse how users use the services, including by noting the third-party site from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to online marketing, as described in the following section.

                                <strong>WHAT ARE WEB BEACONS?</strong>
                                FRHS occasionally advertises on third party web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as &quot;web beacons,&quot;or &quot;action tags,&quot;which count visitors who have come to Our Site after being exposed to FRHS banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personal information and it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to Our Site to gauge the effectiveness of our ads. By navigating on Our Site, you agree that we can place cookie and web beacons on your computer or device. If you prefer not to receive web beacons, then you should stop using Our Site, or consult your browsing settings.

                                <strong>HOW TO CONTROL COOKIES?</strong>
                                Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you choose to turn off these cookies you will still see advertising on the internet but it may not be tailored to your interests. It does not mean that you won &#x27;t be served any advertisements whilst you are online. Whilst we have mentioned most of the third parties involved in using targeting or advertising cookies in the preceding section (What third-party cookies does FRHS use), the list is not exhaustive and is subject to change. Therefore, even if you choose to turn off all the third-party cookies listed in section (What third-party cookies does FRHS use), you may still receive some tailored advertisements and recommendations. There are a number of ways you can manage what cookies are set on your devices. Essential cookies, however, cannot be disabled. If you do not allow certain cookies to be installed, the website/ mobile application may not be accessible to you and/or the performance, features, or services of the website may be compromised. You can also manage this type of cookie in the privacy settings on the web browser you are using. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others &#x27;websites/ mobile applications.
